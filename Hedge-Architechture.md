RAZESEED — FINAL HEDGE ARCHITECTURE (2025 MODEL)
(Execution-Failure Hedge Model with Full Escrow Refund + Conditional Hedge)
🔵 1. Purpose of Hedge

RazeSEED protects investors from execution failure, not market failure.

The hedge is activated ONLY if project execution fails before completing all milestones.

Hedge = 70% downside protection on execution-risk capital (loss amount).

It is NOT activated for:

market failure

post-completion business collapse

competition failure

founder delivery completed but outcome poor

This is industry standard and ensures financial sustainability.

🔵 2. Key Definitions
Total Investment

Amount invested by investor into the funding contract.

Escrow Balance

Unreleased funds held safely in the smart contract.

Released Funds

Amount already withdrawn by founder after milestone approvals.

Loss Amount (Capital at Risk)

This is the most important concept:

Loss Amount = Total Investment – Remaining Escrow

This is the amount that is actually lost if a project fails midway.

Hedge Split

70% of Loss Amount:

35% tokens (locked 6 months)

35% stable (USDT/INR) (vested linearly over 6 months)

🔵 3. Hedge Trigger Conditions (When Hedge Activates)

Hedge activates ONLY when a project fails before completing all milestones, such as:

Founder abandons execution

Severe unmet milestones

Fraud

Repeated delays

AI verification fails

Investor votes/withdrawals force-stop

Platform termination

Failure before final milestone

👉 Execution failure triggers hedge.

🔴 4. When Hedge DOES NOT Apply

Hedge does not apply when:

ALL milestones are completed

Founder delivered fully

Market rejects the product after delivery

Startup runs out of customers after launch

Pivot fails after product completion

👉 Market failure does NOT trigger hedge, because funds were used as agreed.

This is the ONLY sustainable model.

🔵 5. Hedge Payout Structure
(A) Escrow Refund (Always 100%)

Any unspent escrow is automatically refunded 100%.

This is not part of hedge.
This is guaranteed by design.

(B) Hedge Refund (Only on Loss Amount)

Hedge = 70% × Loss Amount

Paid as:

✔ 35% Token Hedge

Minted tokens

Locked for 6 months

Gains value from burns

Zero treasury cash liability

✔ 35% Stable Hedge

Fiat/USDT

Released monthly over 6 months

Prevents liquidity shock

Matches treasury inflow cycles

🔵 6. Token Burns Complement Hedge System

When hedge is paid (project failure), platform burns a percentage of:

Project-linked tokens

Founder’s locked tokens

A portion of protocol supply

This reduces circulating supply and boosts token value, making the token hedge more meaningful.

🟣 7. Complete Examples
EXAMPLE 1 — Failure Midway (Most common & safest)

Investment: ₹10,00,000
Milestones spent: ₹4,00,000
Remaining escrow: ₹6,00,000

Step 1 — Refund Escrow

Investor gets back:
✔ ₹6,00,000

Step 2 — Determine Loss Amount

Loss = 10,00,000 – 6,00,000 = ₹4,00,000

Step 3 — Hedge Calculation

70% of 4,00,000 = ₹2,80,000

Split:

Token hedge (35%) = ₹1,40,000

Stable hedge (35%) = ₹1,40,000

Stable paid over 6 months → ~₹23,333/month

⭐ Final Recovery

₹6,00,000 escrow refund

₹1,40,000 tokens

₹1,40,000 stable (over time)

Total recovered = ₹8,80,000
Loss = ₹1,20,000

Investor loses ONLY 12%, not 100%.

EXAMPLE 2 — Failure Very Early (Huge investor protection)

Investment: ₹20,00,000
Spent: ₹2,00,000
Escrow: ₹18,00,000

Refund

Investor gets ₹18,00,000 instantly.

Loss = 2,00,000
Hedge = 70% of 2,00,000 = ₹1,40,000

Tokens: ₹70,000

Stable: ₹70,000 (over 6 months)

Investor recovers:
👉 ₹18,00,000 + ₹70,000 + ₹70,000 = ₹19,40,000

Loss = ₹60,000

EXAMPLE 3 — Failure at Final Stage (All milestones completed)

Investment: ₹25,00,000
Spent: ₹25,00,000
Escrow: ₹0

🎯 Interpretation

All milestones completed

Founder delivered as promised

Failure is due to market outcome, not execution failure

👉 NO stable hedge applies

💡 This is CRITICAL for treasury protection.

👉 Token hedge still applies (optional: 20–35%)

Investor receives only token hedge.

If token hedge = 35%

Tokens = ₹8,75,000 worth
Stable hedge = ₹0

⭐ Final Recovery

No escrow refund

Token hedge = ₹8.75 lakh

This is the ONLY sustainable way to survive large failures.

EXAMPLE 4 — Failure Late (75% funds used)

Investment: ₹25,00,000
Spent: ₹18,00,000
Escrow: ₹7,00,000

Refund escrow

₹7,00,000 returned

Loss = 18,00,000
Hedge = 70% of 18,00,000 = ₹12,60,000

Tokens: ₹6,30,000

Stable: ₹6,30,000 (over 6 months)

Final Recovery

Total = 7,00,000 + 12,60,000 = ₹19,60,000
Effective loss = ₹5,40,000
